# Read me for Assignment 1 #
Ordering a pizza, 2 pages: order form and response. First time writing an assignment in NodeJS. 
I included a error page because I had some difficulty with using EJS syntax.

# Hi # 
Hi Kris!
Here is my submission for Assignment 1.

Thanks!

## Instructions ##
1. node_modules is not included, please use npm install
2. type in node app.js to launch application
3. Chrome is preferred browser

### What doesn't wasn't fully implemented ###
- priceCalculator is coming up as undefined when calling a function (though I think I followed the module.exports format properly)
- pricing is not shown on order confirmation page
- validation errors will not show up on index.ejs but instead direct user to an error page 

### What I would change like to change in the future ### 
- separate the application logic some more. I feel like app.js file should be more like a controller, delegating the requests and responses to separate areas of the application to be processed and contain less logic

### Final thoughts ###
Lots of self study but learnt a lot. Looking forward to applying the knowledge gained for assignment 2 and prepare for the final.
